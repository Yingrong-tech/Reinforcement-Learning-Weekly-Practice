Due to the subjective nature of pain, it's challenging for healthcare providers to gauge a patient's exact pain level at any given time. Patients provide feedback, which can range from feeling \"comfortable\" to experiencing \"severe discomfort.\" However, these observations might not always perfectly capture the true underlying pain level.\n","\n","The pain management process is visualized as a continuum with three states: Low Pain, Medium Pain, and High Pain. The patient starts in any of these states, and with the right dosage of medication, can ideally remain in the 'Low Pain' state or improve from a worse state. However, over- or under-medication can lead to various complications, including increased pain or potential side effects.\n","\n","* **States**: Low Pain, Medium Pain, High Pain (Pain levels)\n","* **Actions**: Low, Medium, High (Dosage levels)\n","* **Observations**: Comfortable, Slight Discomfort, Uncomfortable, Severe Discomfort (Patient feedback)\n","* **Transition Probabilities**: The patient's pain progression isn't deterministic due to various internal and external factors.\n","* **Observation Probabilities**: Patient feedback might sometimes not align perfectly with the true pain state due to the subjective nature of pain or temporary relief.\n","* **Rewards**: The healthcare provider receives rewards for keeping the patient's pain low and penalties for increased pain or potential side effects from incorrect dosages.\n","* **Discount Factor**: Represents the trade-off between immediate pain relief and long-term well-being.\n","* **Objective**: The aim is to administer the right dosage of medication to ensure the patient remains in the 'Low Pain' state or improves from a worse state, accounting for the uncertainties in patient feedback and pain progression.\n","\n","**Scenario Flow:**\n","\n","1. The patient starts in a known pain state (e.g., Medium Pain).\n","2. The healthcare provider prescribes a dosage based on the current observed state and previous feedback.\n","3. The provider receives immediate feedback based on the prescribed dosage's outcomes.\n","4. The patient provides feedback (Comfortable, Slight Discomfort, Uncomfortable, Severe Discomfort) about their pain.\n","5. The healthcare provider updates its understanding of the patient's pain based on the feedback and known transition probabilities.\n","6. Steps 2 to 5 are repeated during each medical check-up until a specified number of check-ups are reached or until the patient consistently remains in the 'Low Pain' state.\n","7. The overarching goal is to make decisions that ensure the patient's pain remains low or is consistently reduced, considering the uncertainties of patient feedback and unpredictable pain progression.\n","\n","Throughout the scenario, the optimal medication strategy will help the healthcare provider make decisions that ensure the patient remains comfortable, balancing the need for effective pain management with patient safety and well-being."],"metadata":{"id":"lGU39qDUviJ9"},"id":"lGU39qDUviJ9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### POMDP definition\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1e3agtMbgHflQe8YxGJATx9doaCU990To' height=350>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"y02QYyYR0HLv"},"id":"y02QYyYR0HLv"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a generic class for Pain Management POMDP\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","class PainManagementPOMDP:\n","    def __init__(self, states, actions, observations, transition_probs, observation_probs, rewards, discount_factor):\n","        self.states = states  #
